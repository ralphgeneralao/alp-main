  `I can't tell you enough how much your program has changed our mathematics instruction at school. Whenever a staff member comes to be with a math question - my first response is 'Well, lets see what Carol says!' and we will watch your videos or look over your planning. We speak about you like you are an old friend!! Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs 
  My students love maths this year Carol Spencer! They love the videos from Aunty Carol and ask every day if there is a new one from you üòÅ They want you to come and visit! Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  We have been working closely with A Learning Place A Teaching Place, building our teachers‚Äô capacity and confidence in teaching maths- and we are seeing great results. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  We can‚Äôt live without it. Everything is going very well. We are beginning a lot of mentoring around mathematics which is great. A lot of new and beginning teachers. The problem we are finding is that teachers don‚Äôt understand conceptual development and feel the need to push the kids through content they don‚Äôt understand. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  We are small schools but very complicated in terms of mathematics delivery. For instance, I will officially be teaching years 4/5/6 but I know there are some children still operating at Year 2 level. Very complex in terms of planning and delivery and your site is so amazing in terms of differentiation and resourcing. Let alone being research based. You are ticking all the boxes in my past and present experience!!!! I am an experienced and dedicated teacher and am seriously impressed!! Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  Our school is now in its 2nd year using it K-6 and results are great! Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  The website is awesome. It has everything parents, teachers and schools need to encourage thinking, reasoning young mathematicians. Thnx. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  Our teachers have said that their own maths has improved as a result of teaching this way! Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  Put simply ‚Ä¶ Maths makes sense this way!!! Love it!!! Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  It is amazing and I highly recommend this website for your own professional understanding and growth. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  It covers investigation, problem solving, differentiated instruction, tracking, videos, explicit teaching a scope and sequence for every grade, professional learning. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  A great resource for teachers and an exceptional way to really build students‚Äô deep understanding of mathematical concepts. It‚Äôs amazing! Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  This is just awesome. Yes, I use it in my classroom but the professional development it has provided me is unbelievable. We have a school subscription, but if I was ever to change schools, I would definitely get a personal subscription!!! Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  I saw so much growth in mathematical understanding and it really engaged students who previously ‚Äòhated‚Äô maths or thought they were bad at it. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  Absolutely love using A Learning Place A Teaching Place this year ‚Äì the shift in my students‚Äô mathematical thinking and understanding is incredible! Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  Your work is amazing and so easy to follow. Thank you!‚Äô ‚ÄòI am an experienced teacher but am still learning so much about conceptual planning in mathematics through A Learning Place A Teaching Place website. I have subscribed personally for 4 years. The website is continually adding new resources. The teaching videos are wonderful to build your own depth of understanding. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  I have been using your website for over a year now and the students have raved about what they can do and the deep understanding they have now got. Other teachers have noticed as well. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  Students work at their own level. A lot of work has gone into the scope and sequence and the skills build on as it progresses. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  It is the best program I‚Äôve seen! Children acquire DEEP understanding of mathematical concepts and the differentiation and problem solving is awesome! There are also investigations for assessment. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  I just wanted to take the time to thank you for all the work and effort that has obviously gone into ‚ÄòA Learning Place‚Äô. It‚Äôs an incredible resource and something I was more than happy to subscribe to. I am a Year 1 teacher at a school in Brisbane QLD. This year our school decided to no longer teach from a text book, however we haven‚Äôt had the kind of planning that you have done to underpin/support what we are doing in the classroom. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  I personally have found this incredibly frustrating as I come from a specialist background and my planning for that subject was impeccable. What I am so super excited about is that you have done EXACTLY what I envision for our maths program. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  It‚Äôs changed the way I teach maths, increased my understanding and provided my students with a deep understanding of concepts. When kids come to you and say ‚ÄòI used to hate fractions but actually they are quite fun,‚Äô you know you are onto a winner. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs
  It‚Äôs so much more than a program! The professional learning alone is worth the money.‚Äô ‚ÄòIf you don‚Äôt want to spend the money initially there are a lot free resources that you could use as a start. I did this but ended up subscribing anyway. Facebook: OnButterflyWIngs`,
